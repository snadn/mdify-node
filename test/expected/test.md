It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words _italic_ with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com/)

Sometimes you want numbered lists:

1.  One
2.  Two
3.  Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

*   Start a line with a star
*   Profit!

Alternatively,

*   Dashes work just as well
*   And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
    *   Like this
    *   And this

# Structured documents

Sometimes it's useful to have different levels of headings to structure your documents. Start lines with a `#` to create headings. Multiple `##` in a row denote smaller heading sizes.

### This is a third-tier heading

You can use one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading sizes.
